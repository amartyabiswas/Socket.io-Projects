# Socket.io-Projects
Learning to make group chats using socket.io. I learned from various youtube tutorials and have made Bingo-Social-Site, which is in my another repository.
These are basic group chat applications where you can see all the users connected to the particular server.

#### Instructions
```
1. Download or Clone the Repo
2. npm init
```
##### Install all the packages and run
```
3. npm install "package-name" --save
4. nodemon server.js
```
